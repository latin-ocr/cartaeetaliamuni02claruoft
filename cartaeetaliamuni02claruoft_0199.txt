Richard de Kardif was a member oi a well-known family in the connties of Gloncester and Glamorgan.
The Golden Grave Book makes him son of Robert, and nephew of Simon de Kardif, who witnessed a Charter
ΟΑ 1170. [CL] Mr. Knight cites Richard as witnessing a deed by Riehard de Lucy to william, Earl οῖ’
ΘΙοιιοεεῐθῐ, as ‘senescallus' ‘23rd March. 1159. and he witnessed the foundation char-ter of Keynshum Priory
by the same Earl. as ‘Rioardus de Card. tunc dapifer (comitis);‘ it further appears, from a general
confirmation, 11 Edward IL, that he gave land in Mapledurham to the canons of that house [New Mon„
τι, 452] He also gave to Ewenny a rent-charge on certain lands in Eugiand [Arch. Camb.. 1⁸53, pv 168}

Δ fine ot* 24th J anuary, 1197, taken after his death, shews him to have left two daughters. co-heirs, of
whom Amabel, the elder, claimed the half of three parts of a knight's fee in Toppesfeld, and half a
quarter fee in Grancenden. and half a knight's see in Hameleden. and half a quarter fee in ‘Nova-vius
(Newcustle) in Ghmorgan, and half a fee in St. Hilary, and half of three hydes a-nd of a virgate of land
111 Haiston. She was allowed all Nova-villa. Hameleden„ and the service of Grancenden. and the hydes
and virgate 111 Haiston, to her and her husband, Thomas de Sansord, and their heirs for ever.

Hadwise, the younger (ιο-11811, married Thomas de Bavis. They had all Toppesfeld and all St. Hilary.
Nova-villa and St. Hilary were in Glamorgan3 the other places were 111 Essex and Surrey [Fines temp.
R. l].

In his capacity of dapifer to the Earl of Gloucester, the Charter couceding to the burgesses of Neath
the privileges enjoyed by those of Cardiff was addressed to and witnessed by Sir Riehard, as appears
from its recital 111 the confirmation Charter of 20 Richard Π.

Meyric. quoting the now lost register of Nea-th Abbey, says that Sir Richard de Cardiff had thirty
libratos of land in Newton Nottage from Ead William. and held them as the fourth part of a knight's fee
(by the tenure of castle guard at Cardiff), and the Liber Niger mentions him as holding of the Earl half
a fee in Wales and a whole fee 111 Englanrl.

It is not necessary here to pursue the pedigree of the de Cardiff family. They were of Queeuhull and
Walton-Oardiff, in Gloucestershire, and were represented 111 1369 by Edward de Kerdif and Paulinus. his son,
who died sp. ς and in the female line by the Bawdripps and Bassetts of Bfflupre. from J canna.. heiress of
Wm. de Kerdif of Walton, who died 5 Edward 111. Walton was afterwards Walton—Bassett. St. Hilary
no doubt came from the Kerdifs to Baesett of Beaupre, though through what channel is not ascertained.
