June, 175⁴. and afterwards Tyrwhit became a party to Bowen’s petition. aud the Mansel ladies put in
replies. The result was a composition, and it was agreed that the Mansels should make certain payments
to Hugh and Anne Bowen, and confirm certain annuities. The estates to be divided into four lots, one of
East and West Orchard ; Castleton and Gileston to be sold to pay law charges, and to provide a fund for
equalizing the shares. The remainder to be divided into three parts, and the parties to draw lots for them.
Of these, Lady Mansel to have half a half part for life, with remainder to her daughter who had the whole
half and the Somerset estate ; also Bussy's sale in Cardiff to be allowed, Penllyne, Langan, Lamfey. etc„ went

but harbour dues yielded about ‚⁴21 perannum: also kelp raised and burned on the shore, and limestone
raised between high and low water mark. Lead mines in the manor are now no longer worked. Also waste on
the beach. 275 acres is not included in the estate. The measurement, by another statement is 232 acres,
2 roods, 31 poles. Sully island is at one end of the waste. The waste included sand and lime.

St. John, the third name, is that of a family usually regarded as early settlers at Fonmon : but how it
comes that neither he or his fee of Fonmon are here 1nenti011ed,it is diffieult to say. Mr. J ones, the owner
of Fonmon, suggests that probably it was 11οῑ originally held ιή capita of the Lord of Glamorgan, but

forgotten when the heiress of Umfraville carried Penmark to the St. Johns. If this be so, as it probably is,
it is odd that the St. J ohns, not being tenants in chief. should appear among the twelve knights⁴

Berkrolles of East Orchard. the fourth name, does not appear in this Survey. That William de
Bercherola was a 1511110οἭ01- on the Ebbw in Monmouthshire, appears from Bishop Uchtred's declaration
oi 1146,and Roger de Berkerol was a Gloucestershire knight in 1165, but the family probably did not
settle in Gla-morgan till late in the reign οἱ Edu-ard Ι. Before that time East Orchard was one oi
the Nerber fees. In the Sth year of King John, Peter tle Berkrolles is mentioned 111 some local pleadings
as the purchaser of half a virgate of land at Watton, Hei-ts. [Arch. Camb. for 186⁹, p. 693 Abb. placit„

tradition. only as regards six of the twelve knights, who may, therefore, have come in early.

There remains the further question, whether they were the only, or even the most important of the
tenauts in chief. De Granvine certainly was a very large holder, and of the rest De Londres, Sully, and
Umfmville held four sees each, the largest recorded holding⁴ The honour oi Coyty also, held by Turber-
ville, was equally considerable, and Talavan was an important barony; but Le Soor held only one see.
Of the lauded estate of Fleming before 1337, nothing is known.

On the other hand, Nerber held four and Corbet three sees, and yet they are not among the twelve⁴
Gogan also held two, and many others. Nor was it the possession of a castle that gave the rank, for
Someri certainly held Dinas Powis at a very early period, as did N orreis, Penllyne; Walsh, Llandough ;
Barry, Bar-ry Castle: Bonvile, Bonvileston; Winchester or De Winton. Llanquian; Butler (not Piucerna),
Dunraven; and Nerber, Castletou Castle ς of all of which buildings parts, more or less considerable. remain.

Several other tenants, not among the twelve, may also be presumed to have come in very early, since
they gave their names to their lands, and even to whole parishes„ which look as though they were original
allottees. Thus Constantineston or Coston was so called from Constantine: Bonvileston or Bolston,
by the Welsh Tre Simon or Simon’s place, from Sir Simon de Bonyile ς Odyn's fee in Penmark from Odyn3
Gileston or J oelston from J oel; Cogan from Gogan ς Scurla Castle. a manor in Llanhnrry, from Scurlage,
