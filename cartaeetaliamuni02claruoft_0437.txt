minority, which lasted from the 24th of Edward 1. to the 4th ot Edward 11⁴‚1295—1311 ; or, finally,
which is perhaps ¹most probable, the Inquisition may have been taken in 46th of Henry HL, 1262, on the
death of Earl Richard, notwithstanding the majority of his son, and before his livery was granted.

The names of the twelve jurors are written on the ends of the slender labels cut from the deed, and still
pendent to it, and which bore the small seals now lost, The writing is evidently of the date of the deed,
and may have been written to guide those who scaled. The total of fees appears to be thirty-six-and-a-
quarter and one-tenth with a value, supposing 2⁸30 to be added for the three sees in St. Nicholas, of 2518,
besides 242 5s. for wardships and perquisites. There are two other returns with which to compare these
figures, an Escheatof 35 Edward 1. printed in the 1.P.M. for that year, and au Extent ot the reign of
Edward 111. taken by Hugh le Despenser. The former gives on addition thirty-six sees one quarter and
one-tenth, and the latter a sum of thirty-six-and-a-half and one-tenth, to which, however, the addition ot
the iterus does not correspond. The Escheat roll gives no valueS, but the later survey gives figures whjch
amount only to 2349 lOs., and 20 marks, a. considerable falling off. This. however, is probably nominal
only, and due to the omission of entries, for most ot' the fees given are set down as producing as much or
more than is credited to thern in the earlier Snrvey.

The tradition of the county has steadily asserted that Fitzhamon, upon his conquest in 1091, parcelled
out the low lande, those between the mountains and the sea, and from the Rhymny to the Nedd, between
the twelve principal followers to whom he owed his victory, leaving to the native lords, or to such as,
however unwillingly, accepted his rule, the lese fertile and less accessible hill country to the north That
this was the general policy pursued is certain enough, as well as that the sees created paid some kind of
military service to Cardiff Castle 3 but that there were precisely twelve tenants-in—chief‚ and that they
were the knights whose names and holdings are usually given, is opposed to positive evidence. The
present survey goes some way towards supplying an account of the actual state of things, and hence its
peculiar value in the history of Glamorgan.

The knights recorded by tradition are De Londres of Ogmore, De Granville οἱ Neath, De Turberville ot
Coyty, St. 'Quintin of Llanblethian, Siward of Talavan, Umfreville of Pemnark, Sully of Sully, Berkrolles
of East Orchard, Le Sore of St. Fagans and Peterston, Fleming of Wenvoe, Llanmaes, and Flemingston,
St. John of Fonmon, and Stradling of St. Donate.

Of these there is evidence that De Granville founded Neath Abbey with his portion, and he seems to
have retired very early to his richer and more secure fiet at Bideford in Devon. St. Quintia is said to have
failed in the male line, and to have disappeared during the reign of Henry 111. Probably he was of the
family which gave name to Frome St Quintin and other manors in Wilts, but no evidence has been
produced of this, or to show that he was, as usually stated, the ancestor of the heir general who inter-
married with the Herberts.

This leaves teu of the twelve knights to be accounted for, and of them six are found in the present
record, namely, De Londres ot Ogmore, De Turberville of Coyty, Umfreville of Penmark, Snlly of Sully,
Le Sore ot St. Fagans, and, in the list of jurors, Fleming.

Of the other four, Daniel Siward, was doubtless of the family of Siward of Talavan, an important
barony, then, it is presumed, in the hands of the chief lord hy the forfeiture of Richard Siwa1·d‚and there-
fore not here set down. The outline of the castle is preserved, and the name ot the family exists in the
meadow near, still called ⁴⁴ Maes Siward.“

The Stradlings are always counted among the very earliest settlers. This document, however, shows
that St. Donats was then held by Thomas Hawey, not as he held Marcross, for another person, but as his
own. Sir Peter Stradling, about the close of the reign of Henry 111„ married Joan, daughter and heir
of Thomas Hawey of Comb-Hawey or an, cc. somerset, and is always supposed to have been himself of
St. Donate. But that Thomas was not a mere feoffee for his grandson is evident, not only by the distinc-
tion taken between his tenure οῖ’ St. Donats and. Marcross, but by a Plea in Michaelmus term, 15-113
