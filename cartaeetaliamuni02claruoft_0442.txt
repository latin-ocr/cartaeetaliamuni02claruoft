Endorsed-‘ Kayrdiif!

An Extant was an estimate of the value of the land under a writ of ‘extendifacias‚’ issued by the Sheriff.
When the full value was given it was called a ‘full extent!

It was important, as upon it proceedings for debt could be taken without further reference to the value
of the land.

Usually the value reached seems to have been two-thirds of the real value. ’

The Bawdripps were of Bawdripp, co. Somerset, but Thomas Bawdripp seems to have acquired land in
Penmark, before 1339, which he demised to J ohanna daughter of Thomas Odyn, who may have been his wife,
and from whose family the manor of Odyu's fee‚now Penmark Plane, evidently derived its name of ‘Odyn’s '
feel William Bawclripp7 probably their son or grandson, living 1443-4, married Elinor St. John, of Fonmon.
Willianr Bawdripp sold the see, about 161546, to Sir Edward Lewis. They also held Splot, near
Cardiff. John Bawdripp married Elizabeth de Kerdyff, who inherited half a fee in Queenhull, from her
mother J oan de Kerdyff. whose eo-heiress she was* These left a daughter and heiresS, Agnes, who married
John Baseett, of St. Hilary, at 13, in 1395.
