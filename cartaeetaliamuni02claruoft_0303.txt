Regis HENRmI tercii] ad ostendendum si quod jus habetin custodia LANDAVENSIS
ecclesie vacantis et ad illud prosequendum si voluerit. Et comes venit et dicit
quod nichil juris clamat in predicta custodia nomine suo nisi racione terrarum
RmAnm de cmm in GLAMMORGAN quarum custodiam dominus Rex ei vendidit
usque ad plenam etatem predicti RchRm unde ipse habet cartam domini Regis
et unde dicit quod predictus Rmnzmrs et alii barones in provincia ina vacante
sede illius episcopatus et cujuslibet alterius debent singuli ipsorum habere custo-
diam terrarum que de ipsis tenentur salva solummodo domino Regi dignitate
crocie. Et ideo provisum est quod rotuli cancellarie queruntur et si inveniatur
quod dominus Rex vendidit comiti predictam custodiam . habeat eam secundum
quod ei illam vendidit et si comes plus sibi attraxerit quam dominus Rex ei
vendidit dominus Rex perquiret se versus eum. Preterea provisum fuit quod si
domino Regi placuerit fiat inquisicio in partibus Marchie per vicecomitem et
ballivos ipsius domini Regis si barones Marchie vacantibus sedibus episcopatuum
debeant habere custodiam terrarum episcopatus que de ipsis tenentur ita quod

domino Regi nichil accrescat nisi solummodo dignitas crocie.

The circumstances οἱ the Welsh conquest had invested the early Norman lords with powers not
compatible with the Royal sovereignty, and which as the kings gained strength they were disposed to
recover. One of these wae the custody of the temporalities of the See of Llandaff, which was claimed
and exemised, at first unchanenged, by the Earls of Gloucester for the Manor of Llandaff, and by the Lords
of Gower for Bishopston. It appears from the above that Hem-y m. had taken advantage of the minority
of the Earl οἱ Gloucester to contest his claim, which however was resisted by the Earl Marshal, the
guardian of the Earl and custos of his rights. Henry was notin a position to enforce his claim⁷ bnt as
will be seen his son was more successful. It will also be seen that some years later, 111 1250, in the latter

years of Bishop de Burgh, Henry obtained from his son acknowledgment that he held under the Crown
direct, and Earl Richard seems to have assented to this.
