There are several Chai-mers granting or confirming grants to Margam of land in and about Llanveithin
or Llanmeuthin3 mention is made in them of Gilhert and Nest his wife. Henry his son and sibilla his
wifeg also we have Gerebert son of Robert, an Umfraville tenant⁷ and his brothers Adam and Jordan, and
Hugh, probably a deceased elder brother, and no doubt the Hugh de L]ancarvan‚ whose donation of thirty
acres is mentioned in King John's Chai-ter of 1205. As Heni-y, Bishop of Llandaff, who construis the
donations, was promoted from the priory 01 Abergaveuny, and consecrated before 1196, this gives about
1196—1205 as the date of these Clifflters.

The Humfranvilles were lox-ds of Penmark, where the ruins 01 their castle still remain.

Gilbert de Humfranville gave land at Aisse. now Nash, co. somerset, worth 315. per annum, to Tewkes-
bury Abbey for the soul of his wife, and 1104 he was 21 witness 10 an apportionmeut of the Abbey revenues.

[N. Mon. 11.⁷ 66, 81.]

He was, it is believed, succeeded by Robert, who, about 1131, witnessed a Charter to Neath Abbey, by ⁶
Richard de Gmnvffle, and who was probably the Robort who witnessed a Chai-ter hy Williani Earl of
Gloucester, to that Ohurch. [N. Mon. V.. 2691 [⁴¹10de

His successor seems to have been Gilbenz, who 111 1166 held uine Knight's fees of William, Earl of
Gloucester [L. Niger. 161], and who must have died before 1139-90, as in that year Hem-y paid ,⁴24 for
'the relies 01 his land [Pipe Roll, 1 Rich 1]. This is the Gilbert mentioned in the Harleian Charter [CCX11.]‚
which names also Nest, but whether as his wife, or as is more probable, the wife of Urban de Penducaet. is
uncertain,

Henry de Humiranville, his 5011 and successor, was the grantor of the cited Charter. Between 1183 and
1193 he witnessed a Charter by Pagan de Turberville to Margam7 and in 1186-7 he was rated at 245 for the
relief of nine Knights‘ fees held of the Ear] of Gloucester, on which there were due 2332, and 111 the
treasury 213 [Pipe Roll, 33 Hem‘y 11.]

3 John, 1201, 118 fined ten mares on five Knights‘ fees for licence ‘non transfretares [Obl. et Fini 13⁴.
Pipe Roll 2 J ohn.]

Besides the donation recorded in the chartei· 75, D. 15, hey as chief lord, advised and consented to a gift
and confirmation to Margam by Gerebert. son of Robert [CCXHL] originally granted by Hugh de
Llancarvan, elder brother 01 Gerebert [Con. Top. v. 19], and confirmed by fleury, Bishop of Llaudaff> in
another Charter [CCXIV.]. It appears from these that Henry's wife was Sihilla. He probably died about
1203, for in the accounts of the Honour of Gloucester in 1203-4, William de Braose had a quittauce from a
fourth scutage of the five 1885 held by Henry de Humfranville ς and 111 1205 his gift of 160 acres to Max-gam
was confirmed by King John ; and also in 1203-9, Gulfrid Whiting accounted for 100 mares, and a palfnv,
for having custody of the land and heir of Henry de Humfrn-uville [Pipe Roll 5 and 10 John}

This heir was another Henry, the Henry junior of [CCCCLIH.]‚ who witnessed a grant by Leisan ap
Morgan after 1213, and 0118 by Raymond de Suny. He was in rebellion against John. but on the accession
of Henry 111„ and his return to his allegiance, l Hem-y 111„ 1217, a writ was issued to the Sheriff 01 1)8νο11
to give him seizin of his land [Close Roll i.‚ 3133 Fine Rou 1., 258J. cit-uter CCCLVII. mentions his
connection with the Bradington of the chartei· to which this note is appended.

Next in succession was probably another Sir Gilbert [CCCCLII.]⁷ who in 1233 did homage to
Hem-y 111. for the land he had as one 01 the heirs of his cousin Matthew de Torrington [Fine Roll,
i.‚ 238} He was one of the pledges for the Earl of Gloucester against R. Siward in 1245 [DXX.], and
in 12⁴9 witnessed the cyrograph of the sons of Morgan ap Cadwathlan. In 1253 he sued Walter de
Pembroke, Archdeacon of Barnstaple, for impleading him in the ecclesiastica} court [Prynne, Records, iii.‚
109, and Plea Ron of J ustices fflnerary, M. 14, Devon].
