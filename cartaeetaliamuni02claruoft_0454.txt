John de Felda, Abbot of St. Peter's, who died 1263, here declares that he confirms to Herewald. son of
Habraha, the land he had by gift from Emma. de Cogau‚ in Pennun.

Very little is accurately known of the religious foundations, whether secular or regular, before the com>
ing of Fitz Hannon 3 the country was certainly divided into parishes, many of large area, but even of these
nothing certain is known, the Liber Lawlavemis is the chief if not. the only authority. Of the establish-
ments of the regular clergy, the best known and most important were at. Llnntwit and at Llancasvau, and
for what is known oi thom we are indebted to the Liber landavensis. All the Monastic institutione seem
to have been swem away by the Norinans. probably to be replaced by foundations of their own.
