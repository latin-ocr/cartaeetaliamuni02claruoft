He appears also in the various scutage lists in the reign of Henry Π. and Richard 1. He died about
8 Richard L [1196], leaving Alienor, his widow, and two sons, John and Stephen. Alienor paid one
hundred marks to marry as she pleased.

John succeeded as third baron, and was probably of age, ’Ζ Henry ΠΙ. 3 Henry HL, the King respited
the payment of his reliefs on succeeding, From hence to 9 Henry 111„ though twice charged with
homicide, he was a §ustioe itinerant. At the latter date, 1226, he was Constable of Plympton Castle
in Devon; and next year is a charge for his messeuger sent to the King. 18 Henry ΙΠ. [1234] he is
entered on the Fine Roll as “Baro'’ John died 33 Hem-y m. [1248]‚ when his next heir was his brother
Stephen, then above sixty years old. His lands ‘ iu eapite ’ were in Lincoln, Dorset, and Northampton.

Stephen, fourth and last baron, was an active and successful soldier, and, probably as a younger son,
pushed his fortune in South Wales. He did homage as his brother's heir. On his succession, 33 Henry
111. [1249], when the King, in whose favour he stood, remitted his reliefs for the counties of Lincoln and
Dorset, he gave security for 2100. 38 Henry 111. he had the King's part of Kempston‚ Beds.‚ and a part
of Brixham in Devon. The earliest mention of Stephen in Wales is probably in the Rot. de Prestitis of
12 John [29th August, 1210]‚ whence it appears that he was freed of two marks by the King, then at
Margana. He must have been just of age. That he was Vicecomes of Glamorgan appears from the
Charter given above, and from one by Owen and others-1, sons of Alaythur, to Margam, of which he is a
witness, [Harl. Ohart. 75 O. 25] He was not then a knight. Meyrick says that Sir Stephen Bawson
had a grant of Brigan, in Llausaunor, from Bichard Earl οἱ Gloucester, and built a house there. He
certainly held one and a half knights' {ees in Hemingstrasse, co. Pembroke. T. Wykes calls him ‘vir
magne probitatis ' ; and the Oxney ehu-anicla, ‘ miles strenuissimus ’ ; and both, with the Annak
qs Μανςαπι, relate his death in 1257. In that year, before St. Peter's Day, he took a
share in an expedition of some magnitude, despatched by Henry m. to repel the Welsh,
who had laid waste the Earl of Glouoester's lands, and probably those of Sir Stephen. The
advance seems to have been mismanaged, and Sir Stephen and many other English were slain. This was
probably in Carma1·thensh1re; but an effigy in Llansannor Church‚ the parish church of Brigau, is said to
represent his person and cover his remains. Agnes, his xvidow, had in 1257 [41 Henry ΠΙ] a lease for six
γεω-ε, from the King, of the vill and hundred of Wotton, co. Oxou.

After Stephen's death two ladies appear upon the scene 3 but whether they were his children, or those of
his brother John, has been doubted. Dugdale and most of the records give them to John. On the Rous
of Parliament they are attributed to Stephen. It appears from a document printed in 1871 in the Journal
of the Archaeological Institute [p. 312]‚ that they were really the children of John; but it was not till the
failure of the male line that they became heirs of the barony. Oi the two, Matilda was the elder ; J oan the
younger ; but both were under age when Stephen died. The Welsh estates, being a male fiet, escheated to
the Lord of Glamorgan ; but Agnes, the widow, had a third in dower.

The King granted the wardship of the nieces to Elias de Rabayne, who married the eldest daughter, and
took the other ahroad, where she married Bandret, an alien. Rabayne seems to have attempted to acquire
the whole property, on the plea of the alienage of Baudret, who, however, surrendered his wife's half to
the King, who seems already to have seized it in 1258. The result was a suocession of lawsuits. Rabayne
died, leaving children apparently; John, who had lauds in Thoreswey, 9 Edward 1.; J oan, to whom, on
her marriage with Robert de Brakenbury, was given Keneston, a part of the barony, which came to their
son Robert5 and apparently a third child, Matilda. Elias de Rabayne died before 1290, and his widow
married Peter Mallory, a J ustioe of the Common Pleas under Edward 1. and Edward Π. ; 1111ἰ a Peter de
Babayne, probably an uncle, was guardian of the infauts, and died about 1 Edward m.

J oan left a son, Peter Baudret, a Poitevin, who claimed his mother‘s moiety from the crowu without
success- The other moiety was finally, 12 Edward IL, confirmed to Peter de Rabayue either as trustee or
as heir.
