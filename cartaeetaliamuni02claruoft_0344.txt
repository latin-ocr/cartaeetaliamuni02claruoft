Rees Meyrick gives a different account from the above of the relations of Sir Srephen, whom he calls
Bawson alias Bassing. He says he had issue, Thomas, whose daughter and heir, Elizabeth, married
Sir Simon or Sir Adam Walsh, of Llandough, whose daughter and heir, Bettin, married Aaron ap
Howell Vychan, and so on. If there be any truth in this statement,'rhomas must have been a. natural eon,
holding Brigau by special grant from the lord.

There is also an account of the family of Sir Stephen given by Prince in his Worthies of Devon, which
differs materially from the above. He makes him son of Sir Guy Bawcen of Yardbiry‚ co. Devon, and
calls the elder brother Sir Richard of Norton-Bawceyn. He also makes Sir Stephen die childless, aud says
the lands passed to his brother-'s only daughter, who married Sir Richard Hiwish. No mention is made of
any connection with Lincolnshire. The two accounts have not been reconciled. The Devon family bore
for arms, azzo-e, two bars undy qules, a quarter sabla. See Dcxxl
