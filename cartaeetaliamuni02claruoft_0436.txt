St. N icholas7 formerly Llaneilydd, includes that very ancient hamlet of Dyffryn or Tres Golych, after-
wards Worleton. Ralph Button, living 39 Edward HL, married a de la Bere. Their grandson is said to
have married the heiress of Worleton. They ended in Martin Button, who died childless, 1767, when the
estate was sold. A cadet branch remained a few years longer at Oottrell in the same pai-ish. Tewkesbury
had two parts of the tythe of the Lordship of St. Nicholas.

Penmnrk Place, now a farm house, is in part old. It stands within its own manor, and has always
been a distinct property. The old house was much altered by the Tyntes. It contains some old oak
panelling, and parts of the walls are very thick* Sir Thomas Lewis, of Van, purchased it from the
Broadripps, about 1615—10316. and settled it upon a younger son.

Sir Robert Noreys or Nori-is, the Earl's Vice-Comes, was one of Fitzhamon's followers, and he or his
father are reputed to have had a grant of the manor, and to have built the rectangular keep at Penllyne,
the fragment of which is probably the oldest bit of military masonry in the County. [See DCXL1v.]

John, son of R. le Butsser, was the father of William and of two daughters william died before
47 Henry HL. and left Joan who died under age, when the estate was contested by three ladies, two
daughters of the younger William, ant] their aunt a daughter of the elder William. How the matter was
settled does not appear, hut Α pendente lite‚' the Earl of Gloucester as chief lord held the Glamorgau
property. There was also a suit in Wilts, 27 Henry HL, as to the dower, in Wilts, of Wentlehand
[WenllianL widow of Robert le Butiler, who held Poulton, ‘et fuit anglicus.¹ His heir was his younger
brother Baldwin.

Of William le Butiler's heiresses, one married a de la Bere, and John de la Bere held half the Marcross
fee in 1320, his widow and hen-ess married Elias Bassett of St. Hilary.

This is the earliest Eextent or Survey of Glamorgan which has yet been discovered, and probably the

earliest now in existence. Though not dated, it is one of a roll of ten documents relating to the same
cornay, also without date, but which are referred to in the Calendar as of the 8th year of Edward 1.
Before admitting the precise correctness of this date, explanation is needed how it happened that an
inquest undertaken,as some of these are stated to be, and this, from its company, probably was, ‘ per
preceptum domini Regis should go foi-ward when the lordship was not in the hands of the Crown.
Gilbert the ned, Earl of Gloueester and Hertford, son and heir of Earl Richard by his second wife Mutilda,
daughter of John de Laey, Earl of Lincoln, on the death of his father, 46 Henry III„ was of full age, as
appears by his having livery at. once of the iuheritance, which he held nnmolested till the lBth of Edward
I. In that year in consequence of a brcach of the peace between Earl Gilbert and the Earl of Hereford.
und of an impending marriage with the king‘s daughter, Earl Gilbert surrendered his estates to the king,
who immediately regranted them. on hie marriage. with a new settlement.

The Earl died ‘2¹ Edward L, leaving his son and heir, Gilbert, the last Emi, then five years of age.
