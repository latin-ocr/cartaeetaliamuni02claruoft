These inquisitions, together with one for the whole county, though without date, appear to have been
taken 011 the death of Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester and Hertford, in 46 Henry HL, 1262, in order
to ascertain what where the particulare of the Earl's feudal rights over the lordship of Glamorgau, upon
which the ang's claim for reliefs and other feuda] incidents was to be calculated. As the Earl's son and
successor was of full age, there was no question of custody ot lands or wardshjp of the heir, but an
ordinary case of succession only. The returns show the burgage rents, the assised or fixed rents, and
those paid by free and rustic tenants, the latter being such as held by socage, with an obligation to
perform agricultural services on the lord's land. The free tenants are sometimes within and sometimes
outside the borough boundaries, being then called ί Forinseci.’ The cotarii were mere cottagers. Among
the dues are those from market tolls, fisheries, prisage of beer, receipts from fairs, perquisites from the
lord's courts, rents from the demesne lands, arable, moor, or meadow, operationes or obligations to assist
in getting iu the 101·ᾱέ harvest or to repair his waggons, and, more valuable than all, dues to the lord's
mills These, 10 Cal-diff, amounted to nearly one half of the whole receipts3 in Llantrisant, much exposed
to the inbreaks of the Welsh, only to one· -twenty -third part; 111 Llangonydd to one- eleventh; in Neath to
one- sixth; and 10 Llantwit, far within the English boundary, to the same.

The reign of Henry ΠΙ. was a period of frequent inbreaks of the Wels h, but still it is surprising to find
that in Llantrisaut, which, however, included Pentyrch and other villages, as many as 100 houses had
been burnt, in Llangonydd 80 houses, and 111 Neath 150; and yet Neath appears to have been walled, and
both it and Llantrisant were defended by strong castles. In the hamlet of Garth—Maelog, two carucates
of land, usually yielding 22 Gs. 1οξ(1Ἰ were utterly waste.

The Public Records afford confflcting evidence as to whether the two ladies, heir-esses of Sir Stephen
Bausson (better known as de Baiocis), were his daughters or those of his elder brother, the preceding
baron. The Lysworney return settles this point. Agnes is well known to have been Sir Stephen's
widom aud here it appears that she held her third ns dower, and the Earl, in the absence of heirs of Sir
Stephen’s body, took the other two-thinis. The two nieces were at that time of age, and married.

The names of the inquisitor-s show the 111-011010οο0 of the Welsh in the border parishes only. In Cardiff
all twelve are clearly English. In Llantwit the same. Lu Llantrisant, perched astride upon the hius,
and notwithstanding its castle, peculiarly exposed, all twelve are Welsh, as they are in Llangouydd. In
Neath. though much exposed, the presence of the castle aud abbey probably attracted strangerS, for, of
the twelve, seven only are decidedly Welsh, and five English. Here are some Welsh tenauts, who do not
elsewhere appear, save in Llantrisant. Adaaf ab Ivor pays 2s. ior a sparrowhawk, probably involving a
licence for fowljng. The payment ‘ad lardarium' is possibly for allowing the hogs to fatteu or produce
lard in the lord's woods, and answers to pannage, also mentioned, though why the two phrases should be
used in the same schedule does not appear.

The inquisitions give the advowsons of Llantrisant, Pentirch‚ Llangonydd‚ and Neath, and omit those
οὶ Cardjff and Llantwit with Lysworney. Llantrisant, however, belonged to Tewkesbury Abbey from
an early period, Pentirch was iu the hands of the Dean and Canons of Llandaff, and Llangonydd, 111 Margam.
Neath seems always to have been in the hands of the lord of Glamorgan, and so descended. Llantxvit,
held with Lysworney, was in Tewkesbury.

It 10 curicus that though the general return is called ‘Extenta Comitatus‚’ or of the county, no mention
is ever made of the Earl, save as holding the two-thirds of Lyswomey, of which Agnes Bausson held one-
third. Unfortunately the Earl's schedule in the 1.P.M.‚ though very full as regards England, has
only one Welsh eutry, the manor of Marci-oss in mamm-gan, which 111 the County Extant is not in the
hands of the Earl, but in those of Thomas Hawey of St. Donats, evidently held for the heiress of Richard
Butler. Hawey certainly held this by licence from the Earl, for iu the Cal. Genealogicum, 1. 107, this
Richard is entered as having held Marci-oss manor as custos of J ohanna la Butillere, who was daughter
