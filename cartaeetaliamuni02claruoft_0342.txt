Thomas Nerber, living 7 Hem-y VL, married Gladys, daughter and heiress of William Thomas. They
had John, and Catherine who married David Powell. [n this same year, lst April, 1429, Thomas witnessed
a donation by Sir Edward Stradlyng to Cardinal Beaufort and other feoffees of the manor of Lanfey in

A Fonmon deed records Robert Nerber, who had a grant of Llancoviau manor from Thomas Lyddyn
and William ap Llewelyn3 no doubt trustees, to whom he had previously conveyed it. The settlement
was on Robert for life, with remainder to Lewis Mathewe, Esq., and Elizabeth, his wife, and their heir-s and

John Ner-ber, of Castleuou, married catherine, daughter of Sir Roget Vaughan, of co. Brecknock, and
had Agnes Nerbe1-‚heiress of Castleton, who married, 1st, Thomas John of Brigan3 and eud, Morgan
Thomas. Agnes died childless aud a widow, “ZOth Sept., 1558. Her inquisition, subjoined, shows that she
held no lands ⁵ in capite ' or direct from the Crown. Castleton was held of the Lord oi G-lamorgan.

The Manor House of Castleton stands upon the brow of a steep hill which rises about a hundred feet above
two flat mai-shy valleys which here unite. The main or southern valley is traversed by a substantia] bank
intended to pen back the waters into a pool for the working of a mill, the ruins of which remaiu at the
northern end of the bank. The northern valley is a mere combe. The two, uniting, join the Tawe about a
qual-ter of a mile lower down, close to East Orchard Manor House. The house has the aspect of a very
substantia] farmhouse of the reign of Elizabeth or James, having on each front the ordinary three-light
Tudor window of the (ΕΒΗ-ἰοῖς each light with a round head, and the whole under a flat dripstone with
square returns. On enter-ing the building it will be seen that the greater part οἱ it is of the sixteenth
century ; the old doors and thick walis, and some other details, remaining untouched. The hall, of Tudor
date, is a low, long room having oak beams in the ceiling with panel-work οἱ embossed plaster, the pattern
being a fleur-de-lis. It lies north ancl south, and at its north end are the old doorways which led into the
kitchen and offices. The east end and wau of the house are evidently the remajns of a far older building
than the rest. probany of the original castle of the first Norman lord. The wall is exceedingly thick, and
contains a, sinan chamber in its substance. In this wall is the carved lintei of an old fireplace‚ rudely
executed‚ but apparently of early perpendicular work. Among the ornaments is ‘a hart lodged,' a tiger
or lion concham, a fleur-dedis, and some curicus frets or knots, all in stone. The greater age of this
eastern wall is confirmed by an examination from the outside. The building has evidently formed the
south and part of the east side of a quadrangulas court of considerable size, the gatehouse into
which is built up in a barn on the north front. There are there two arches—one on a high drop—arch of
about 1⁶2 feet opening‚with a plain chamser3 and on the east side of this a smaller portal, of 6 feet opening,
for ioot passengers. These evidently are the remains of a late Edwardian gatehouse.

It would then appear that here stood originally a late Norman or Early English castle; that it was added
to, or altered, in late Edwardian times, and a spacious courtyard enclosed3 and that, finally, the defensive
parts were removed in the Tudor period, and the remainder converted into a farmhouse.

(4) It is difficult, in Sir Stephen Bawcen, to recognise Stephen de Baiocis, lord of that barony in the
county of Lincoln, and a baron of the realm. His name is corrupted into many forms. Among them are
Bause, Baucen, Bawson, Bman, Bayhus, Buzun, Baiocas, Bays, and Bayens or Bayensis, au indicating his
origin from the Norman city of Bayeux.

The pedigree opens with Ranulph de Bayeux, a great Lincolnshire baron in the time of Henry 1., and a
benefactor to Newhus Abbey. He married Margaret, daughter of Aian de Lincohx, and had Hugh, Alan,
and othei-s.

Hugh, the second baron, held ‘per baroniam· the barony de Baiocis, containing fourteeu and a half
knights’ sees, the distribution oi which appears in his return to Henry 11„ recorded in the Liber Niger.
