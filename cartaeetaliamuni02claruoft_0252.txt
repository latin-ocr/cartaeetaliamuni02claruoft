Of Osbern Besae nothing is known. :md Hoheleswrdi has not been identified. Possibly they were among
the swarm of small landowners. native und foreign, who were settled near Max-gam, and were donors to its
Abbey. Croc is a better known name.

It appears from the taxation of Pope Nicholas that Margam held lands, ιι windmill. aud certain rents,
the whole valued at §.12 Os. 103511. in aud about Tokynton3 and to this it is probable that the 01111·ῑεί-
relates. Of the gramm- nothing has been discovered. Foshroke (H. of Glouo . IL, 105) mentions a family
of Croke who held under Rath Abbey in Tokynton or Tokintff‚ and appear in an inquisition, 16 Edward Π.
Roger Croke held the property, ὁ Edward ΙΙΙ. : und John Croke. outlawed for felony, 2] Εὼνεινᾱ HL, held the
superior mauor of OIveston under the Prior os Bath. Peter was, no doubt, a. member of this family- He
was of Olvezton in 12:32. A Gilbert Croc witnessed william Eat-l of Gloucester's Charter to Neath t and
about 1166 Ruald Croc held a Knight's fee under the same Earl william. :ts- recorded in the Niyer Liber· os
the Exchequer. Mr. Floyd meets with ιι waher Croc in the Pipe Roll for Stust'ord. 31 Henry Ι. 3 and iu the
