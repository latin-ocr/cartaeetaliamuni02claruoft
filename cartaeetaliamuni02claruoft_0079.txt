Herebert de St. Quintin tests a Charter by R. dc Hnia in the time οἱ Fitzliamon [N. Mon.² iv., 633]Ι
Richard de St. Quintin, in the time of william, Earl of Gloucester‚ gave the Church οἱ Frome St. Quintia
to Tewkesb11ry; and Richard de Gmnvine gave to Neath the mill of Pandeh'a, which he held of Richard
de St. Quintin [N. Mon„ V„ 58]. They were a wealthy and numerous race, holding lands in Wilts, Dorset,
Essex, and Yorkshire, in which last County tho nunc is still found. In Glamorgan they built the Castle of
Llanblethian, of which a good Edwardian gnte-house remains.

1205. Herbert gave 3015 for his holding of ten [ees of the Honour of Gloucester in Wilts [R. de oblatis,
3 Joth. ὁ John, he is rated upon one see in the same Hononr. Also another Herbert held lande,
43 Edward ΠΙ, under Hugh de Audley and Margaret, his wife [A.R.O. 11].

In 1201 he holds the ten sees in Wihs, and in 1205 Herbert de St. Quintin and Agnes. his wife, held
lands in Yorkshire‚ and probably this is the Hei-bert referred to in the charter. Herbert de St. Quintia was
summoned to Parliament in 1294, and iu consequence the Earl of Pembroke7 who married his heir general,
assumed the creation of a Barony in fee; bnt the connexion with the Glamorgnn family, though highly
probabk, has not been proved.
