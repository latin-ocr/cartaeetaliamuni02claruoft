Asceline is elsewhere unknown 111 Glamorgan. He was probably a small landowner near Margan, as
were the other persons named in the Chal-ter, but Rohertus filius Asceline held one fee of Earl Patrio,
iu Wilts‚ aud one of Walter Waleran [L.N.‚ L 107, 108], and also charged scutage for one might, in Wilts
1166, [L. Ruber, 1. ⁵240}

Philip 0011 appears as a landowner near Kenfig.

The name of Thumi-d, Tusard⁷ 01· Tosard, first appears 111 1147—1134, when Hem-y Thusard petitioned
1110 Abbot of Tewkesbury for leave to build a church 111 Kenefeg (Kenfig)‚ to be served by himself for his
life, 110 paying a pension of ls. 011 each feast of All Saints⁴ This was the parish church of St. ι11111105, and
seems to be the rebuilding of a previous church. This gave rise to a controversy in 1154 between St.
Leonard’s, Newcastle, represented by Parson ι1011, presbyter there, and Master Henry Thusard, concerning
tythes. This same Henry witnesses an undated Charter concerning cnm-ch Iands at Kenfig, and another
Henry witness&- a 011111101- by Robert‚ Earl of Gloucester, in 1338. W. Tussard tests a Charter by Maurice
Croe, confirming, in 1262, a gift of land 111 Laudmays. Also 111 1257, Michael Tussard held, under Margan,
two parts οἱ messuage, a croft, a garden, and an acre of land at ιι rent of 22. This was probably the same
who held one-sixth of a see 111 Llantwit in 1317, valued at 105.
