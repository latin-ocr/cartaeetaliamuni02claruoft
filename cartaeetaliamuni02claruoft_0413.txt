This Charter is attested by five of the earliest and most prominent οἱ the follow-ers of Fitz Hamon:
St. Quintim de horidi-es, de Sully, Fleming, and Cantilupe ς de Londres being quite at their head in both
wealth and importance [see No. CLX.], St. Quintiu aud Czintilnpe, cadets of great English families, and
Suuy and Fleming in the first rank of the local Baromge For St. Quintia see No. CCXCI.

william de Caudio, or Cantilupe, bore a name very widely known throughout the Welsh Marches3 but
the actual connexion of the family of Gower and Cantilupeston with the Barons Cantilupe and the
mnonized bishop of Hereford, has not been ascertained, although various circumstances, besides the
peculiarity of the name and arms, render the connexion more than probable.

Sir William Cantilnpe of Cantleston or Trecantlo Castle. in Merthyr Mawr, is reputed ancestor of
william, Elias, and William, three generations allied by various ties with Dunstanville of Cornwan,
Umpffiaville, Vaughan, Butler, de Londres, and de Braose oi Glamorgau and Gower. Robert de Cantelow
tested a Gower deed in 1304, and a Margam charter [73 A. 43] in 1308. The Welsh pedigrees deduce the
Lords Cantilupe of Abergavenny from this ancestry ς 'out this is exceedingly improbable, and the reverse
is more likely to be true. It seems certain that Cantieston, Neu-ton, and Comellau, were conveyed in
marriage by Joan, the Cantelupe heiress, to Horcon, whose gramidaughter, Janet, daughter of Jenkin
Horton, married Richard, aud was mother of the well known Sir Matthew Cradock of New Place in
Swansea.
