Strictly speaking, G1amorgan, though held with the Honour of Gloucesten was not :m Honour nor
included in that of Gloucester, though the distinction was sometimes neglected.

Probably, when the estates of the Saxon Brictric were granted to Fitz flamen, they were erected into
the Honour of Gloucester. John detached the Castle οἱ Bristol from the Hon0ur3 the Castle of

Gloucester never belonged to it. The statute ‘Quia¹ emptores terrarum ” put an end to subordinate teuures
in Capite, confining it to holdings direct from the Οιποκνιι4

Henry Π. died seized of the Honour of Gloucester by escheat. It descended to Richard 1.‚ who
enfeoffed Prince John of it. who held it iu fee ‘per Barouiam' by homage and service. John was
afterwards disseized of it in the Royal Court, but it was restored to him by his brother Richard. When
John beoeme King, the Honour vested in the Crown, and the homage and service ceased on the part of the
Lord, but the tenants held ‘ut de Honore in Capite* Fieis held at second hand, being held of the Lords,

¹ who held of the Crown. On the Continent they were styled · Arriere-fiefsf

The Lordship oi Glamorgan seems to have passed into a sort of abeyance between the co-heiresses of
Earl Robert, until the Crown determined which sister should inherit.

KNIGETS' LODGINGS, CARDIFF CASTLE,

The maze of {able that has invested the early settlement of the Lordship οἱ Glamorgan has thrown
doubt upon aU statements not absolutely proven, and among others upon the belief that the Knights who
held by Castle Guard were bound to maintain houses within the Castle precincts. The matter is however
set at rest by this document, hy which the King calls upon the Barons and Knights of the Honour of
Glamorgan and Cardiff (a phrase here used carelessly) to maintain the houses within the Castle Bailey,
and to keep ward there, as they were wont to do. The honses were within the outer ward of the Castle,
where their foundations were lately laid open. and where also was originally the Town Hau. of Cardiff.

The hmmes, being within the Castle, were the property of the Lord. but the tenants were to keep them
m repair.

The Pipe Roll of 1208 shews that John was expending ΞΨΖ 1ος. on the repairs of the Castles of cardiff
and Neath, and he therefore with some reason called upon the chief tenauts to do their duty.
