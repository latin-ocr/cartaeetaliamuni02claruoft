See DXLIV. for Robert and Aliza de Bonevilla's gift to Margana.

Next, probably about 1260, occurs William de Bouafflla, son of John, who gives to the monks of
Margana forty acres of 111-111118 land whichNthey held of the Templars in the time of his father, paying to
them foi-ty peuce annually. This seems to be a gift on condition that the laud shall be his and not the
Templars‚ and was probably taken by the monks as a measure of precaution [75 B. 17], It may be
observed that King J ohn's Charter euumerates, next after the Boneville grant, foi-ty acres given by the

Templars.

Soon afterwards Abbot Gilbert is t'ound executing agreements with John le N ori-eye, who holds lande and
tenements in Bonevilestou of the Convent, by which Norreys admits the holding at the seisin of 1211. per
annum, and monthly rent at the Abbot's Court of Bonvfleston, paying the foreign service and reasonable
relies to the Abbot when due, with custody of the lande and heir when a minor, and fealty. For those
considerations, and at the instance of Gilbert7 Earl of Gloucester, the Abbot warrants to 18 Norreys and
his heirs the tenement of the fee of Bonvileston should he (the Abbot) be impleaded in the Easter Court,
but should 18 Norreys be so impleta-ded, and cast, he can only come upon Mai-gam for a pair of gilt spurs
oi ed. value, as value of the land so lost, and 18 Norreys covenants under a forfeiture of 2100 sterling not
to seu more than the gilt spur& [75 A. 36]

In 129171st February, the Abbot,as Lord of the fee of Bonvileston,is partyto an agreement with Thomas
le Spodur of that place, by which Thomas gives up,in perpetuity, an acre of land, a house and curtilage in
the vil] of Tudekistowe, which Thomaffi son of Robert Acus, formerly held of Margana, and which lies
between the Margam land a-nd the main road towards the common called Newton’s Down. In retum the
Abbot grants to Thomas two acres in the fee, one in Redelond field and one near the vill‚which Roget, son
of Cady, formerly held, paying 14d. per annum, and doing snit of Court. At Thomas* death a heriot of 55.
to be paid. [75 Α. 42]

In 1302, 2-1th J une, John, son and heir of Heni-y de Bonvyle de Bonevylston. informs the faithful that 118
has demised and acquitted to Margam, for himself and his heirs. 143. sterling of a certain 405„ annual
rent due to him from the Abbey, and this in exehange for Hs. annual rent upon the tenement which
Philip 18 Especer formerly held οἱ Margam in Bristol, and which is now assigned to his lord, Reymund
de Su115e‚who 111 returns 81118011»ζ John and his heim of 145. rent in exchange for 203. wln'ch Matthew
Everrard, Joan his wife, and Hugo their son, used to pay to Reymund for a tenement held by them at
Holeton, in the lordship of Dinas Powys. A somewhat complex arrangement, showing de Suny to have
been Boneville's iord, and pointing to the retirement of the Bonevilles from the eounty. [75 B. 22]

It does not here appear how (le Sully came to be the superior lord of de Bonevilleg perhaps this may
be connected with the superiority oi Wenvoe over Bouevileston, mentioned above, and the fact that iu
1262, as appears by the County Extent, Walter, the then lord of Sully, held also two sees in Wenvoe.

A deed of ’25111 J uly, 1375, mem-ds an exchange by the Abbot and convent of two acres of arable land in
Redelond, und five acres next the old castle on the northern side of Bonvileston‚ with Will. Wrouuo
[Gn-ono] de Boneviiesztmi, against his seven acres next Heligogy on the west side. [75 A. 43] The
Spencer Survey of 1:320 mentions Ma : Bonville, m. plough lamis. This may be Maurice Bonville.

‘zoth November, 13:30, occurred a plea before the Sheriff of Glamorgan between the Abbot of Mai-gam aud
John le Woledon, who held a free tenement under Mau-gam in Bonevileston, for which John le Flemyug
of St. George's claimed service. Woledon absconded, leaving nothing behind, upon which the Abbot
became responsible to John lc Flemyng. [Francis MSS]

30111 November, 1377,anindentu1·e was agreed to between the Abbot and convent and John Denys of
Waterton, by which they granted 111111 in farm eighty-nine acres of land in the fee of Bonvileston, during
