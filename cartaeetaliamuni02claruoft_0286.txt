It was the practice of the English Kings from the reign of Edward Ι.. about 1285, in the event
of a war with Franz-e, to appropriate the sums usually sent abi-omi. This was done by the three Edwards
and Richard 11.‚ possibly on occasion seizing upon the whole revenoe, but still restoring it at the con-
clusion of the war. Henry IV. at first shewed great favour to these Priories, but towards the close of
his reign he regarded them with suspicion, and, 'Yth October. ὃ Hem-y IV.y he seized upon Llangenyddg
and to indemnify the Priory of Ewenny for its losses from the rebels and others, he granted to the Prior
a. lease of the Alien House for 10 years st 220 per annum—a lease which, however, seems to have been
revokecl by Henry V.‚ who restored the Priory to St. Taurinus on condition that they appointed fit persons
for its head. and accordingly Richard Day and Richard ap Morgan, the latter, at least, a native, were so

appointed.

Fiually, all the Alien Priories were dissolved by Henry VI. (2 Henry VI.) and their possessions vested
in the Crown, and for the most part applied to religious and educational uses. Llangenydd was granted
in 1 141 to All Souls' college, Oxou„ in which body the pan-onage ot the Church has since remained.

This Charter is interesting as containing evidence of κ, connection between the family of Lab-alea, whose
head quarters were in Laleston, and those of Penrice and De Ia Mare in Gower. Henry Mansel, the wit·
ness, is an early member of the family of Mansell. which afterwards held Penrice, and much other land in

Gower.
