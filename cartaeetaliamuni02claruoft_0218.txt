There vvis a Philip Maeiog, temp. Hem-yvl. The following particulare are supported hy better evidence :—

Migister Radulphus Maylock. or Msielog, was an ecclesiastic and u, member of a family who appear in
the early records of the county, and were extant as late as the reign of Henry VI. As Magister Rafe
Maiioc, he tested rt thtrter by lumel. Countess of Gloucester aud Essex [Ni Mon. iv., 634]‚ andan Umfra-
ville Chai-ter of 1217 [75 D. 14]. His nume also appears in the Annals qs Tewkesbury as holding the Church
of Llanblethian apparently in farm. He died an June, 1231, aud about the 15th September following, the
Blshop of Llandaff, Thomasv Deam of Hereford, Peter, Abbot of Tewkeebury, Maurice, Archdeacon of
Llandaff, the Rector of Thorubury, and others, met at Striguil to dispose of the Church of Llanblethian,
The result was the sending of Eustace, a. Tewkesbury monk, to take seizin of the Church. On his arrival
the keys were removed to the hffls, aud he could only take seizin of* the porch, and protest against those
who opposed the rights of his convent. confirmed hy the Bishop of Llandaff.

So little effect had this in his favour that the people stopped him on the highway and held him three
days in the hills. Upon which Bishop Elias excommunicated all and sundry in full chemel-,and presented
his sentence to the Justiciar Hubert de Burgh. Further, the Abbot of Tewkesbury excommunicata}
J. Grant. with his accmnpliceS, who did the deedr

How the matter was then settled does not appear. Probably hy the continuance of the Mayloc interest,
for 25th July, 1242, during a Welsh riot in the county, the Abbot of Tewkesbury went to Llanblethian to
receive the ‘ mission ’ of that church, under the mandate oi the Prior of Wiuchcombe, snb-delegate from
the Pope‚ on account of the deprivation of Roger Mayloc, upon his non-payment foi· the farm of the
Chul-ch, But the Arehdeacou of Llandaff, seda vacante, had put in Thomas Pennarth, which could not be
all-owed. On this Thomas resigned the vicarage, and was again presented by the Abbot, with all the
emoluments save tythe shczives, :ind did homage. Mayloc then petitioned to hold the Chnreh to farm, as he
had held it. but the Abbot refused this, and in the court :it Cardiff declared that if he or his suffered injury
he should impnte it to Mayloc.

Finally, however. 011 thot¹ petition os Rhys, Roger's uncle, and of others, Roget was allowed five maros
per annum. He was dissatieflcwl with this. and an extra mare added to it, at the instance of Richard de
Clare, who gave him letters υἱ defonce to the Sheriff.

The contumacious noges Mayioe entered the benefice, seized the wheat, ground it, and carried it off,
adding divers threan-¹ against the Towkesbury monim, and. in short, made himself so obnoxions that the
Abbot had to buy him off with twelve mares per annum until lie should obtain a benefice. The pro-
cecdings must have been rapid. for the Alibot's first visit xva-¹ made *25111 htx-,and ath Sept. Thomas. vicar
of Llanblethian. had lii.q doen> soah-12, :ind did homage.
