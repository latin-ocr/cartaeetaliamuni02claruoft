hill still known as Garth Maylog. The family of Someri had the manor and castle of Dinas Powis very
early, for Roget de Someri of Dudley Castle had it on his death, 1 Edward 1. It seems to have fallen into
waniship, as Matilda, widow of Earl Riehard de Clare, granted, 4 Edward 1.‚ the custody of it and of
Roget the heir, then 18 years of age, during his minority to Alina Countess of NortoIk, daughter of Philip
Basset of Wycombe.

The Survey further supports the statement of the disposition of the hill country among the greater
Welsh lords, of whom Morgan isacium, head of the Jestyn 111-1111811 of Avan, had Baglan, that is to say, the
lands from Aberavan to the Nedd‚ most of which came afterwards to the Houses of Mai-gam and Neath.
The sons of Mor-gan ap Catlwallan, also from Jestyn, had half a commolze= or Welsh hundred, in Glyn
Rhondda. They were then in possession. It appears from the Annals of Margam that Murgan their
father was crueily, and probably fatally tortured by his kinsman Howell ap Meredith in 1228. Griffith ap
Rhys, oue of the Van family, had the large tract of Senghenydd above and below the Caiaeh river, being
two commones. The eommote held by Mordiht ap Greffid [Mei-edith ap Griffith] seems to have been
mainly in Gwent, or beyond the Rhymny‚ in a quarter where the two counties of Monmouth and Glamorgan
are still intermixed, parts of parishes belonging to one running into the other. Mei-edith was lord of
Hirvayn commote in Caermarthen as well as of the northern part of the modern Hundred οἱ Wentlloog in
Monmouthshire 3 he desc-ended paternally from the celebrated Rees ap Griffith‚ and materna-ily from Howel
of Caerleon, and through his mother was heir to Howell’s son. He died 1270. See Brut, p. 357, and Cal.
Geueal„ p. 272.

Some other names occur in the Survey concerning which a word or two may be said. iValter de
Gloucester was Escheator to the Crown on either side of the Trent at various times in the reign of
Edward L, and lived into that of Edwnrd Π. Ivel Fitz Robert does not occur elsewhere as connected with
Glamorgan, neither do Pir-aton nor clifford. The family of De Cardiff. of Walton Cardiff in Gloucester-
shire held Newton Nottage by grant from William Earl of Glaucesoer, one of whose Charters is witnessed by
Robert de Cardiff. whose heiress married Sanfmd, who also had a quurter of a fee in Leckwith. Cardiff oi
Lanririd or Llantrythid was a kinsman, whose daughter seems to have carried that manor to Bassett.

with the heiress of Sir Ph. (18 Marcross gave him that fee. Chapel, in which William Mayloe held half a
fee, seems to he the same with Littlebone and Llystalybont, a manor nem· Cau-diff held by him in the
Spenser survey. There was a Galfrid de Constantine, who had possessions in Bedfordshire and Ireland in
the reign of Hem-y 111„ possibly of this family‚ since migratione to that country from Glamorgnn were
common.

The Welsh Cogau seem to have been the head of the family, whereas those of the othei-⁵, as Sully
