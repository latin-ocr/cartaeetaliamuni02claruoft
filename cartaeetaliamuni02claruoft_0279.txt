by Serjeantry the keepership of a forest in 1212-17 ; also in Hants, and in the Honour of Gloucester where
Henry Esturmi held two hydes 111 1210-12 ; as well as in other parts of England. John Sturmi was Lord
ngh Admiral in 1324-5. stormy Grange was included in the Crown sale of Margam to Sir Rice Mansel
in 1540 [MCCCLXV.] and in the additional sale of Horgrove and Pyle in 1543 [MCCCLXXV.].

Galsrid, or Gauii-id, Sturmi is the first on record in Glamorgan. He leased to Margana at a perpetual
rent of half a mark, the land which he held in Mar-gam under Earl william, who confirmed the transaction
in 1170, reserving the service3 Roget, son and heir of Galsrid, consenting [OL.]. Galfrid Esturmi, with
the consent of M. his wife, Roget and Galfrid his sons, and Agnes his daughter, granted to Mai-gam
his land on the bank of the Kinithwin, circa 1170, [CCL] all which grants were confirmed by Pope
Innocent in 1203, and by King John in 1207 [CXLVIII.—CLI.] about which time Galfrid built the
Ohurch in Villa Sturmi, which, however, has long since disappeared [CLXXXIX] and which led to the
dispnte about tythe between Roget Stin-mi and the Parson of Newcastle. Ln1179‚ Henry 11. confirmed
the family grants to Margam, and one by which Gaffred and Roget gave the residue of the land held ot
Earl william within the fec of Mal-gam. Roger, the son and heir of Galfrid, joining with his father in
the grant [CCL1.—GCOX1V.]. He settled half the rents of Sturmieston upon his sister, Agnes, when she
married Griffith Began. He also witnessed Charters in 1185-91 and circa 1200. Countess Isabel confirms
a gift as “liberorum hominum meorum, scilicet terram Sturmy,” if this was a Sturmi grant, it is an
unusual way of describing the donor [CCCXXVJ. For this the Monks were to pay 12 marks of silver
and a cappa and four nummi to etich son, and when the donor became infirm he was to be admitted
into their community [OOL.].

Began is now a village near Cefn Mably and part of the estate. The manor was held of the Lord of
Wentloog by the tenure of quart-21· of a Knight's see. It seems to have formally been Begansley or Beganton,

 

15 still known as Began's weit. The Began-s were probably native landowuers, but no record exists of their
being connected with that place, which, according to the Welsh pedigrees⁷ belonged originally to the
Gamages. Andrew Pagan, second son of Pagan de Gamage was of Began, which became the portion
οἰ Elizabeth his daughter, who married Wflliam Kemeys. Another version describes Jorworth or
Edward Kemeys as marrying Nest οι· Ε112ε1110111, daughter of Andrew Beauehamp, and heiress of
her brother Andrew, who died 1320, leaving Beganley7 said to be a corruption of Beauchampsley, How-
ever this may be, Began has certainly for centuries been part of the Kemeys estate, and is said to have
been their seat before their removal to Cefn Mably.

There is no regular pedigree of the Begans, what little is known of them is derived from the Charter
[CCCCX01.—1·234], where the children οἰ Griffin Began announeed that an amicable settlement was
arrived at between them and their maternal uncle Roger Stuuui, concerning the moiety of the rents of
Sturmieston, they, by the advice of their father, and with consent of Res ap Griffith, their overlord, with-
drew their claim to the moiety of the half mark which the monks of Margana were wont to pay annually to
Roget· for the land. of Sturmieston, 40 pence which Roget gave to their father on his marriage
with his sister, their mother. The mother-'s name was Leuki sturmi. For 111 DCXC.,C1-adoc‚ son of
Griffin, confirms to Walter de Regny six acres in his tenement 01 Lan Leuder, with the advowson of
the church‚ the land was between thatof Rees Began and of Leuki, widow of Griffin Began. It seems
to have been in East Glamorgan, near Caerau. Also in CCCCLXXVIH.‚ Galfrid Began makes a similar
confirmation, and soon afterwards mention is made of the church at Begauston. In 1320-1, Walter Began
witnesses a Keufig Charter3 in 1487 Robert Began occurs as a burgess of cowbridge‚ MCCL1.; and
in 1515 David Began appears to be connected with Pendoylon.

It is moreover stated 111 the Welsh pedigree that Henry Kemeys, Evan ab J enkyn Kemeys, Regiuald
Kemeys, Roget and Morgan Kemeys, J ames and David Kemeys, were all of Began.
