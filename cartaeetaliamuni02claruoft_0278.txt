Geoffrey sturmi granted to Margam, confirmed by Roget his son, at half a mark rent in perpetual

farm, the land which he held under the Ohief Lord, who, in the person of Earl William, in 1170 confirmed

Geoffrey also, with the consent of his wife M„ his sons R. and G„ and his daughter Agnes, granted to
Margam his land between Hei-hert‘s land and the bank of the Kinithvin on certain terms, all which granta
are euumerated and confirmed in King J ohn's Charter to Max-gam in 1207. [CL„ CCL, CCLI.‚ OCCXIV]

Geoffrey sturmi also* built a church at Sturmi, which gave rise to a dispute about tythe between Roget
his son and the parson of Newcastle.

william. Geoffiey eudowed her with certain 1ands,on her marriage, which afterwards they exchanged

with Geofi'rey fur other la-ndS, which other lande they granted to Margana for the benefit of the sou] of
Geoffrey, with nemin reservations.

who married Griffith Began, and had seven sons, who had a ‘loquela ³ with their uncle Roget as to their
mother's portion, which however was settled 111 1234, in which year the uncle made a final donation to
Margam. as above appears. as also did the nephews and their parente.
