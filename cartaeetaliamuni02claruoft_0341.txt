The Nerbers had lands in Devon, as was not uncommou with Glamorgan feudatories. 8 Richard Ι.
[1197], William Nerbert was petens, and William de Poniard, of Lidiard, tenens, in a fine relating to a fee

Also in 11 of John [1210]‚ in the same county‚ Philip de Nerbert is temne against William Painel
petens, conca-,ming a knights §ee in Bery Pomm-oy. [Fines, 8 R. Ι., p. 40, and 11 ι10110, p. 68.]

year Thomas and Henry de Nerber are on the court held 111 the assize between the Abbot of Neath and
Lleisan ap Morgau. About this time ·' willelmus de Ner-ber [lebet x. marcas pro festinando recto de feodo

requiri de Godfrido de Dinres [A.]‚’ against whom he pleaded. It has been suggested that William Fitz
John was william, son of John de Harptree. Were the Nerberts Harptree tenants in Somerset ἱ)

An Extant in the Record Offiee shews Philip de Nerber, about 1252, as upon a jury at Cardiff. He held
a quarter of a. knight‘s 188 in Llancarvan. This Philip and Maurice, his brother, witnessed, in 1257, a
Charter by Ph. de Cornele : Oomele was amanei· near to Margam. In 1289 8 Philip de Nerber, possibly the
same, witnessed an agreement between Gilbert de Clare and the Abbot of Neath. [Francis's ΝεατῘι, p. 34.]

At the inquisition upon Gilbert cle Cla-re, 24 Edward 1. [1295-6], No. 107, Richard de Ner-ber was a juror,
and was probably the same who, by the inquisition on the death of Countess Joanna, in 1307, held a
messuage and four carucates of land at St. Tathank, valued at 26s. Sd. per annum, and a tenement in
Pennyne valued at 3s. 401. 3 the latter, no doubt⁷ as custos of John le Norreys, 8 minor. [1330881Ἷ 35
Edward L, p. 47.]

Philip de Nerber succeeded, and had four knights* fees iu St. Tathan's at the inquisition on the last
Earl Gilbert in 1315; when, however, Philip was dead⁷ and the fees divffled, Castleton, a part of those
1883, remained iu the name. Richard de Nerber was upon this same inquest.

The Spencer Survey of 1320, names Richard lord of 11811 a fee in Llaneovian manor 3 and Rich-ard, pro-
bably the same, lord of half a fee in St, Tathan's ; the latter being certainly Castleton. This Richard
witnessed, 15th May, 10 Edward H. [1317]‚ a Char-ter by Sir William de Berkerolles concerning messuages
in St. Tathan's, J oelstone‚ and Llanfey.

In 1322 another Philip Nerber was a serviem, performing military service due from John de la Mare
[Writs‚1., p. 1216] 3 and in 1327 Philip de Nerber was on a. jury to inquire into the rights of Giibert
Turberville [Escaet.‚ l Edward m„ 2nd No. 97] ς and in 1333 he sat 011 a jury to decide upon a claim by
the Abbot of Margara. Philip also witnessed a Charter, 28111 J uly, 1335, by David, rector of Coity, confirm-
ing to Roger, son of Sir W. de Berkerolles, and to Katherine, his wife, the manor of Merthyr Mawr.

John de Ner-ber, at. the inquisition upon Hugh le Despenser in 1349, held half a fee in Llaneovian and
half a fee in St. Tathan's, each valued at 60s. pei· annum. John died lst May inthis same year [1349]‚
seized of the 11181101· of Oastleton and advowson ot' St. Tathan's, held by knight's service at 24 3s. 9d. per
annum, leaving his son and heir, William, then aged two years and eight days. On 22nd June, 1350, his
wardship was sold to Guy de Brien for 5:100 per annum [Escaet.‚ 24 Edward HL, lst No. 6 ; and Abb. Rig.
Rot. IL, 2IOB.]. In 1350, William Nerbert was on the inquisition upon Thomas Joil [Joel of Joelston
or Gileston]; and upon that of Christian Fleming in 1360 [Escaet., 24 Edward 11„ lst No, ὃς and 34
Edward L, A. No. 11]. This was 1349-50.
