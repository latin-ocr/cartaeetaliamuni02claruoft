The tei-ms ot this Charter have given ris-c to the notion that the Graux-illes* Castle no longer existed,
and had been placed west of the river Nedd, between it and the Tawe, no doubt on the right bank of the
former river. The remains of the present Castle are later than the Gmnvilles, as late perhaps as the reign
ot' Edward 11„ but it is singular that there should be no local tradition of a preceding Castle on another
site [LXVIIJ.

Charter CCCIX. shews that the Monks of Neath paid 100 mares and a palfrey for the Castelwick and its
appurtenances, and for all Richard de Grauville‘s laud between Nedd and Tawe. The tenemeuts of the
King's burgesses were reserved. the Monks receiving their homage and rent and the Κίος the service due.
Half the fine and the palfrey were already paid.
