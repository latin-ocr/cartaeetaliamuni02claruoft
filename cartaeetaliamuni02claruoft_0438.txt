Edwurd 1,, by which Earl Gilbert de Clare claimed the marriage oi the heir of John or Thomas de Hanweye
[Haweyj against the Lady Beauehamp, of Somerset, on the ground that aney held lande under him at
St. Donats. [Abb. Placit„ p. 213]

The Str-adlings appear to have held lands in Warwickshire. Dugdale mentions John de Strattelenges
and Maud his wife (7 Edwa-rd 1.),as of Whellesborne Hastang or Parva, and as having a grant of a market
there (13 Edward 1,), 11150 (21 Edward I.), the Lord John de Stratelynges or Estradlynges, was lately
deceased, and owed §5200 to the Lucca merchants. His pledges were Gerard de Winstane (Ρ) Archdeacon
of Richmond, and Walter de Langton‚ Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry. There was also a Thomas
Eeoeling, who witnessed a charter by the Earl of Leicester before 1167. In 50 Henry 111„ Roget Stratle
and Matilda, 1115 wife, and Richard tle la Bere and Alicia, his wife, had seizin of their wives’ lands. On
Bth J anuary, 1296, Matilda aud Margaret de Stratelyng, were going to Brabant with Margaret, the king's
daughter. In 1298 Peter de Sti-atelyng was in heland, J oan, his wife, who was evidently an heiress [Cal.
of P. Books, 1292—1301,] was also going there. It 15 possible that this is the J oan, daughter of Thomas
de Hawey, the owner of St. Donate, and that Peter de straten-ng is the same person as Sir Peter Stradling,
who :required St. Donate, and also Comb-Hawey 111 Somerset, by this marriage. His descendants
remained at St. Donats until 1738, when they became extinct in the male line.

The extinction of the main line of the Stradlings, and the contest that arose between the claimants
under the Will 01 the last baronet, the next 01 kin, and heirs·at-law‚ are embodied in the record of a very
memorable suit-at-law, followed by the partition of the estates. These were the 01151105 of St. Donate,
Suuy, East Orchard, aud Penllyne, and the manors of St. Donats, Sully, Monknash, East Orchard,
Merthyr Mawr, West Orchard, Castletou, Court Llanfey, (Εἰ-1105100, Merthyr Parva, Penllyne, Gorton, and

image, besides various tythes and advowsons and rights of fishing and other manorial rights ς also lands
in Somerset.
