There seem to have been two families of the name in the lordship, one, the principal. held land in Gowcr,
the other, appears 111 Charters connected with Cardiff οι· that part of 1118 county. Peter, Bishop of
St. Davids, in 1176-1190, confirms :i grant, of thirty acres given by William de Burri to Neath. In 1201Υ
William de Bai-ri, owns rents in Walterston [OCLXVL]⁷ aud from a confirmation by King John, in 1208,
it appears that the land was in Gower, 11 further appears iu 1230 and in 1250 [DXLHLL that the land
was the whole 188 of Villa walteri or Walterstou, in Gower. William de Bru-ri occurs as a juror for
the earliest 01 the Comitatus of Glamorgan, circa 1262, but. neither his name nor the name of the place
are found in 1118 appended list of feudatories or 111811· fees. Meyrick says, Williaim de Batti, was held of
Cantflupeston. 111 1281—1290, william de Barri witnesses a de Braoee Charter, and 111 1247, Sir William
de Barri witnesses an Avan Charter [DXXXHLJ.

Lucas and Thoma de Barri occurs in 1338, in a Neath Chai-ter [DCCCCLXVHI.]; Richard de Burri
witnesses a Penmaen and Oxwieh 011111181- [DCCCXOV1L]; and a Gower Charter in 1420 [MCXV.].
These all belong to the Gower family.

These of 1118 Cardiff family are less numerous and probably less important. In GCOXCV. Milicent,
daughter of William Mitdehorguill, makes a donatiuo 10 Ma1·gam,in gratitnde for a former gift, of one
silver mark to enable her to pay the relies of her land of Burry, in the see of St. Nicholas; 11 seems ae
though this referred to a St. Nicholas in Gower, in which case 11 may be another Barry, it could scarcely
be Bam-y in East Glamorgan.

The names of 1110118 of 1118 Eastern braneh, so far as they have been recorded, are as follows 2——

william de Barri witnesses a Dinas Powis Chanar, without date [DOLI. and DOLXXIIJ. Walter de
Barri witnesses Charters at or near Car-diff [DOCCXLVIII.]. Also in 1281, a Bonvileston Oharter [DOOL.].
